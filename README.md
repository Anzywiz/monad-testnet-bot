# Monad Interaction Bot

If you're farming the Monad testnet and want to automate interactions across multiple accounts, this bot is for you. It supports interacting with contracts from several ecosystems, including Apriori, Magma, and Kinstu staking. The swap functionality is based on Monorail's API. If there are any bugs, they originate from Monorail and will be resolved in due time.

## üöÄ Features

- Auto interaction across several Monad ecosystems.

* Displays verified tokens held across all ecosystems on Monad.
* Auto swapping and staking with random amounts and wait times to mimic human interaction.
* Supports multiple accounts and proxy integration.
* Auto-funding from a primary account with sufficient MON balance.
* Configurable daily swap and staking cycles.
* Colored display for improved readability.

  "PROXIES": "",
  "GITHUB_USERNAME": "",
  "FUND_AMOUNT": 0.5,

## ü§î Why This Bot?

I noticed that most Monad scripts create false interactions when I checked and verified the hash. This bot ensures genuine and verifiable interactions across multiple ecosystems.

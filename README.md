# Monad Interaction Bot

If you're farming the Monad testnet and want to automate interactions, this bot is for you. It supports interacting with contracts from several ecosystems, including Apriori, Magma, and Kinstu staking. The swap functionality is based on Monorail's API. If there are any bugs, they originate from Monorail and will be resolved in due time.

## ü§î Why This Bot?

I noticed that most Monad scripts create false interactions when I checked and verified the hash. This bot ensures genuine and verifiable interactions across multiple ecosystems.
